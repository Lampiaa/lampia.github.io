            <p>Wanting to create a place that connected people to the earth, Izaba and Tomomi opened their own restaurant called Terrazen Centre. 
                Terrazen Centre is a place that not only serves food, but transports people to another dimension of life. 
                Letting people connect with both the earth and each other through unique vegan dishes inspired by their japanese and carribean backgrounds.</p>
